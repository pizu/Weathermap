        <p>Specifies where to draw the 'newest data' timestamp on the map.</p>

        <p>The data collection part of weathermap collects a timestamp for each piece of
        data, alongside the actual data. This is intended to signify the time that the
        data was actually valid
        - it would be the file modification date if it was a text file, or the current
        time if it was a live SNMP query. The minimum and maximum of these times are
        collated, and can be shown on the map with MINTIMEPOS and MAXTIMEPOS.</p>

        <p>If no MAXTIMEPOS line is given, then the timestamp is not drawn. </p>

        <p>You can optionally specify an additional parameter to change the text of the
        timestamp. This text can contain special tokens which are substituted with parts
        of the current time. The default timestamp text is
        <nobr><tt>Newest Data: %b %d %Y %H:%M:%S</tt></nobr>. The tokens follow the
        same format as the PHP <code>strftime()</code> function but are
        translated internally and passed to <code>date()</code> for rendering.
        The supported tokens include <tt>%Y</tt>, <tt>%m</tt>, <tt>%d</tt>,
        <tt>%H</tt>, <tt>%M</tt>, <tt>%S</tt>, <tt>%b</tt>, <tt>%B</tt>,
        <tt>%a</tt>, <tt>%A</tt>, <tt>%p</tt>, <tt>%z</tt> and
        <tt>%Z</tt>.</p>

        <p>You can control the font used to draw the timestamp with TIMEFONT, and the
        colour that it is drawn in, using TIMECOLOR.</p>
